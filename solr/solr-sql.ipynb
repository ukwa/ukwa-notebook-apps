    "\n",
    "This notebook is for experimenting with Solr's Parallel SQL interface, especially via an SQLAlchemy plugin so that it's exactly like normal SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatley, current state of play is that Solr 6 does not cope with SQL queries on _aliases_, so it's not much use for text analysis right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL system does work okay for Solr 8, but the `SELECT *` logic seems to be a bit brittle (at least via the SQLAlchemy module).  It works pretty reliably if the fields are explicitly enumerated."
